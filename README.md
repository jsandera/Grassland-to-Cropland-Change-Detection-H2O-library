R scripts have been developed as part of Ph.D. project. Presented scripts implement mapping changes from Grasslands to Arable Lands with help of machine learning algorithms implemented in H2O library (https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html) with help of Sentinel 2 satellite data. H2O library offers integrated function called AutoMl that automatically tunes necessary parameters of implemented machine learning algorithms without deeper knowledge. Presented R scripts are interactive, so that it means anyone can use them. Implemented workflow can be utilised for general land cover classification that is common task in remote sensing.
